# IntuiLab
A virtual, interactive physics lab to explore basic physics concepts.

The idea is to allow for early stage physics intuition building by interacting with simple systems. Some labs are more qualitative, some are more quantitative. Do with 
them what you will. The concepts explored are core concepts in physics and are chosen to be most helpful for learners who are just starting out in physics, though each 
lab is still also just plain fun, so feel free to mess around no matter your skill level!
